# Insurance Premium Data

The insurance industry is driven by the simple fact that the capital spent by the insurance company in response to beneficiary claims should not exceed customer premium. The higher the difference between the approved customer claims and total premium received, equates to higher profits. Generally the more data we have on a customer, the better we are able to understand their needs, as well as assess the risks involved in insuring them.

Using the data provided, analyse the premium prices charged to customers.
